## Version 1.1.0

### Install Notes
See the [README.md](README.md) for installation instructions

Please run `npm install` after upgrading due to new dependencies.

### New
- Complete rewrite of UI - now supports both Portrait and Landscape view making it more suitable for phones

- Added controls for Loop, Shuffle, and Auto Radio
- Added a check to see if the extension is enabled
- Added visual feedback when clicking overlay buttons
- Switching zones is now much more responsive
- Depreciated the "Light" and "Cover Light" themes

### Implemented Feature Requests
- Added config file for server settings (config/local.json).  The example file `config/local.conf.EXAMPLE` shows usage and is tracked by `git`.  The `config/local.conf` is not tracked by `git` so that local settings will not be clobbered by `git pull`.
- Added command line options for help and to set the server port (`node app.js -h` for usage).

### Fixed Bugs
- After switching a zone, the zone_id did not update for the controls. This could lead to controlling the previous zone with the new zone's controls.
- Tweaked jquery.simplemarquee.js to use "span" instead of "div". Caused problems with CSS layouts.
- Rewrote zone message parser to handle multiple events per message.  Caused problems with zone list improperly reflecting grouped and ungrouped zones. Likely root cause of previously reported problem with repeated listings in Zone Listings.

## Version 1.0.1
- Resolved bug that could result in repeated listings in Zone Listings
- Changed all icons to utilize SVGs from Material Design Icons (https://materialdesignicons.com/)
- Dramactically reduced the number of times the icons were being called and redrawn
- Changed default theme to "Cover Dark"
- Set default icon theme to "Circles"
- Added configuration option to select icons between icons with or without circles
- Miscellaneous aesthetic changes

## Version 1.0.0
- Initial Release
