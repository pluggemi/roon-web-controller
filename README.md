## Installation
Ensure that Node.js version 6.x or higher is installed.

Grab the software:
* Via git (preferred): ```git clone https://github.com/pluggemi/roon-web-controller.git```
* Or download and extract the zip file.

Change directory into the software:
```cd roon-web-controller```

Install the Node.js modules
```npm install```

Run the application:
```node app.js```

On an existing Roon client, go to "Settings" then "Extensions". Click "Enable" beside "Web Controller".

Open a web browser to your server at either "http://localhost:8080" or "http://(IP of Device):8080".

### Firewall ports
Many operating systems now have a firewall enabled by default. Make sure that the port that this is running is open on the firewall.  By default, this is TCP port 8080.  But this can be changed with the configuration file or command line options below.

### (Optional) Local configuration file
Simply copy `config/local.conf.EXAMPLE` to `config/local.conf` and edit `config/local.conf` as needed.
* `config/local.conf` is not tracked by `git`, so it will not be clobbered with updates
* `config/local.conf.EXAMPLE` is tracked by `git` and will be updated in the future as new options are available

Content of `config/local.conf.EXAMPLE`

```
// Copy this file to "local.json" and change the port as desired.
{
  "server": {
    "port": "1234"
  }
}
```

### (Optional) Command Line Options
This is the output `node app.js -h` which shows usage of the command line options.
```
Roon Web Controller

 A web based controller for the Roon Media System.

 Usage: node app.js <options>

Options

 -h, --help          Display this usage guide.
 -p, --port number   Specify the port the server listens on.

 Project home: https://github.com/pluggemi/roon-web-controller
```
### (Optional) Sample systemd unit file
[systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) is the init system used by modern Linux systems.  Here is a sample systemd unit file which can be used to automatically start this application at Linux system boot time.
```
[Unit]
Description=NodeJS app - Roon Web Controller
After=network.target

[Service]
User=node
WorkingDirectory=/srv/node/roon-web-controller
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node app.js

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
#### Usage
To use this unit file:
* Save this template to a file called ```roon-web-controller.service```
* Edit the ```user``` field to be the user running the application
* Edit the ```WorkingDirectory``` field to be the location where the application is installed (**NOTE**: the ```user``` must have read and write access to this location!)
* Using either ```sudo``` or as ```root```, copy the edited ```roon-web-controller.service``` file to ```/usr/lib/systemd/system```
* Reload systemd: ```sudo systemctl daemon-reload```
* Start the application: ```sudo systemctl start roon-web-controller.service```
* Enable the application at boot up: ```sudo systemctl enable roon-web-controller.service```

You can monitor the output of this application using ```journalctl```.
* To show the application output: ```sudo journalctl -u roon-web-controller```
* To follow the application output: ```sudo journalctl -f -u roon-web-controller```

**NOTE:**
Some Linux distributions - including [DietPi](http://dietpi.com/) and [Software Collections](http://www.softwarecollections.org/) (addon repository for Red Hat, Centos, and Fedora) - install the Node.js binaries in a different location.  You can find the executable by running `which node`. Adjust the `ExecStart` line accordingly.

Here is a list of common locations:
* `/usr/bin/node`
* `/usr/local/bin/node`
* `/opt/rh/rh-nodejs6/root/usr/bin/node`
* `/opt/rh/rh-nodejs8/root/usr/bin/node`

## Credits
In addition to those packages installed via npm, this project uses:
* [jquery.simplemarquee.js](https://github.com/IndigoUnited/jquery.simplemarquee) to automatically scroll the long text
* Color palette from the KDE Visual Design Group [Human Interface Guidelines](https://community.kde.org/KDE_Visual_Design_Group/HIG/Color)
* Icons from [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/)
* [Color Thief](https://github.com/lokesh/color-thief) to calculate the dominant color of the album art
